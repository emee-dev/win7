# Windows 7 Simulation with Svelte 5

Welcome to the Windows 7 Simulation project, crafted for the Wizzbangery Wizard track of the Svelte Hackathon. This application emulates some of the Windows 7 operating system's interface and functionalities, utilizing the latest features introduced in Svelte 5.

## Features

- **Desktop Interface**: A faithful recreation of the Windows 7 desktop, complete with draggable icons and a functional taskbar.
- **Applications**:
  - **Calculator**: A simple arithmetic calculator.
  - **Video Player**: Play videos in a native-like player.
  - **Camera**: Access and display webcam feed.
  - **Notepad**: A basic text editor for note-taking.
- **File System Simulation**: Navigate through a mock file system with folders and files.
- **Games**: Classic JavaScript games integrated via iframes.

## Technologies and Svelte 5 Features Used

This project leverages several new features from Svelte 5:

- **$state**: Manages local component state.
- **$derived**: Creates derived state based on existing state.
- **$effect**: Runs side effects in response to state changes.
- **$effect.pre()**: Executes effects before DOM updates.
- **$derived.by()**: Specifies dependencies for derived state.
- **$bindable**: Enables two-way binding with custom components.
- **$props**: Accesses component props directly.
- **Context API**: Shares data between components without prop drilling.
- **Composable Components**: Utilizes dot notation for nested components, e.g., `<Component.NestedComponent />`.

### Template Syntax

- **{#snippet}**: Defines reusable snippets of code.
- **{@render}**: Controls conditional rendering.
- **bind:** Binds properties for two-way data binding.
- **use:** Applies actions to elements.

### Special Elements

- **`<svelte:window>`**: Interacts with window-level events.
- **`<svelte:boundary>`**: Handles errors gracefully within the component tree.

### Runtime Functions

- **onMount**: Executes code when a component is first rendered.
- **onDestroy**: Cleans up resources when a component is destroyed.
